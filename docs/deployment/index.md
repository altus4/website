# Deployment Guide

This section provides comprehensive guides for deploying Altus 4 in various environments, from local development to production-scale deployments.

## Quick Start

For a quick production deployment:

1. __[Production Deployment](./production.md)__ - Complete guide for production setup with MySQL, Redis, and NGINX
2. __[Docker Deployment](./docker.md)__ - Containerized deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
3. __[Monitoring Setup](./monitoring.md)__ - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting

## Deployment Options

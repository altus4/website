# Deployment Guide

This section provides comprehensive guides for deploying Altus 4 in various environments, from local development to production-scale deployments.

## Quick Start

For a quick production deployment:

1. **[Production Deployment](./production.md)** - Complete guide for production setup with MySQL, Redis, and NGINX
2. **[Docker Deployment](./docker.md)** - Containerized deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
3. **[Monitoring Setup](./monitoring.md)** - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

- **[Local Setup](./local.md)** - Setting up development environment
- **Environment Configuration** - Managing development vs production settings
- **Database Setup** - Local MySQL and Redis configuration

### Production Environments

#### Single Server Deployment

- **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** - Deploy on DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS EC2
- **Bare Metal** - Deploy on dedicated servers
- **Resource Requirements** - CPU, memory, and storage considerations

#### Containerized Deployment

- **[Docker](./docker.md)** - Single-node Docker deployment
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration
- **Container Security** - Best practices for secure containers

#### Cloud Platforms
